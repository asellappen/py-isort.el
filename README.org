* py-isort.el

Provides the =py-isort= command, which uses the external =isort= tool to tidy up the imports in the current buffer.

Install =isort= and download =py-isort=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip install isort
$ wget http://git.vanneva.com/py-isort.el.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/py-isort.el \
       -O /your/path/py-isort.el
#+END_SRC

Add the before-save-hook to your ~/.emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/your/path/")
(require 'py-isort)
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'python-isort-before-save)
#+END_SRC

You can also install py-isort with MELPA:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x package-install RET
py-isort RET
#+END_SRC

Now every time you save your Python file =isort= will be executed on the current buffer.

To customize the behaviour of =isort= you can set the =py-isort-options= e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq py-isort-options '("--lines=100"))
#+END_SRC
